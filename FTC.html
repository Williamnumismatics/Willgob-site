          This weekend, I have the privilege to be attending the FTC 2025 North Sydney Qualifiers as a member of Team 19296 3MB.
          On the 22nd and 23rd of November 2025, we headed to Pymble Ladies College to participate in the Sydney North Qualifiers for this year.

        <h3>The game this year was similar to Basketball with robots. The following video is the how the match works: </h3>

          During the qualifiers, we played a total of 6 matches. Our team did really well, winning 4 out of the 6 matches we played.
          Our highest score in a match was 172 points which was the record until playoffs/knockoffs. The First day was pretty chill as we only had 2 matches in the span of 8 hours. 
          The second day on the other hand was total chaos with us playing 4 matches in about 3 hours.
          Unfortunately, we were eliminated during the second round of Playoffs but still got a invitaion to Nationals in two weeks because we wond the Think Award 1st Place.
